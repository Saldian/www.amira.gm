                                        Hello! My name is Salieujang Jallow thou some people may find it difficult to pronounce it exactly as it is but i don't mind being call "Saljang" I am 20yr old girl of a medium height, strong, healthy,  i respect my seniors and love my geniors. I am a Gambian and a Muslim I live in coaster road. We are a family of five i am one of the three siblings we lived together as one happy family. But after some years my parents and i got apart when i was just 17years of age "uhm what a sad moment". when i choosed to stay with my sister to complete my education. I come from a middle class family my Dad is a business man, my Mom is a housewife.I love my family very much and i enjoy spending time with them. <br>
                                        I was born and raised in Bakoteh, where i spent most of my childhood life time and started my schooling there. After some years i moved to Jiboroh where i did my Genior school and later on came  back to the kombos at Bundung and attended Charles Jaw Memorial Academy where i graduted in 2019. <br>
                                        I'm currently a student at MDI "Management Development Instituition" studying Computer Science. Many people spend a lot of time to decied on what to do after graduating from high school but i am fortunate in that i already know; My coming to MDI was a dream because i want to be a programmer. I always keep in mind my lifelong dream of becoming a programmer. 
                                        I have been taking my education very seriously because i was lucky enough to even complete my high school compare to my siblings and now at Tartiary level i'm so much grateful. <br>
                                         My greatest weakness is public speaking, i always find it difficult to express myself in public. One of the hardest things i've ever had to do was to  present in class, new situations always make me a bit nervous i was too shy and afraid thinking that people will laugh at me when i speak.
                                        But i hope with time it will change because i believe with difficulty there is ease Insha Allah. <br> I love to spend time with people who will bring out the best in me, not the stress in me.
                                            I'm not thesame everyday,there are times where I'm loud and times where I'm really quit that's Me, Myself, & I.  <br>
                                    
                                          
                                        </P>

                            <div class="">  I am single and still searching "lol" I pray for someone who will take care of me not materialistically, but take care of my soul, my well being, my heart, and appreciate me the way i am, whatever.
                                In 5yrs  time i want to see myself there and will  be like "yes I've made it a dream come true" i want to be that responsible woman with hustle not dependent anymore Insha Allah.

                                I'm not yet working but i will appreciate any opportunity the future may hold.
